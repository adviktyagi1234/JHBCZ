        <p>Did you notice that we are able to bend
            or rotate our body in places where two
            parts of our body seem to be joined
            together â€” like elbow, shoulder or neck?
            These places are called joints. Can you
            name more such joints? If our body has
            no joints, do you think it would be
            possible for us to move in any way at all?
            What exactly is joined together at
            these joints?
            Press your fingers against the top of
            your head, face, neck, nose, ear, back of
            the shoulder, hands and legs including
            the fingers and toes.
            Do you get a feel of something hard
            pressing against your fingers? The hard
            structures are the bones. Repeat this
            activity on other parts of your body. So
            many bones!
            Bones cannot be bent. So, how do
            we bend our elbow? It is not one long
            bone from the upper arm to our wrist. It
            is different bones joined together at the
            elbow. Similarly, there are many bones
            present in each part of the body. We
            can bend or move our body only at those
            points where bones meet.
            There are different types of joints in
            our body to help us carry out different
            movements and activities. Let us learn
            about some of them.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1>Activity 2</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Roll a strip of paper into a cylinder. Make
            a small hole in an old rubber or plastic
            ball (under supervision) and push the
            paper cylinder into it as shown in
            Fig. 8.2. You can also stick the cylinder
            on the ball. Put the ball in a small bowl.
            Does the ball rotate freely inside the bowl?
            Does the paper cylinder also rotate?
            Now, imagine that the paper cylinder
            is your arm and the ball is its end. The
            bowl is like the part of the shoulder to
            which your arm is joined. The rounded
            end of one bone fits into the cavity
            (hollow space) of the other bone
            . Such a joint allows movements
            in all directions.</p>

        <h1>Pivotal Joint</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The joint where our neck joins the head
            is a pivotal joint. It allows us
            to bend our head forward and backward
            and turn the head to our right or left.</p>
