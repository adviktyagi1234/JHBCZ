         <p>Sit absolutely still. Observe the
            movements taking place in your
            body. You must be blinking your
            eyes, time to time. Observe the
            movements in your body as you
            breathe. There are so many movements
            that happen in our bodies.
            When you are writing in your
            notebook which part of the body are you
            moving? Or, when you turn and look at
            your friend? Different parts of your body
            move while you remain at the same
            place, in these examples. You also move
            from one place to another â€” you get up
            and go to your teacher or to the school
            compound, or go home after school. You
            walk, run, skip, jump and move from
            place to place.</p>
