            <p>Bowl an imaginary ball at an
                imaginary wicket. How did you move
                your arm? Did you rotate it at the
                shoulder in a circular movement? Did
                your shoulder also move? Lie down and
                rotate your leg at the hip. Bend your
                arm at the elbow and the leg at the knee.
                Stretch your arm sideways. Bend your
                arm to touch your shoulder with your
                fingers. Which part of your arm did you
                bend? Straighten your arm and try to
                bend it downwards. Are you able to
                do it?
            </p>

            <p>Place a scale length-wise on your arm
                so that your elbow is in the centre
                (Fig. 8.1).
                Ask your friend to tie the scale and
                your arm together. Now,
                try to bend your elbow.
                Are you able to do it?
